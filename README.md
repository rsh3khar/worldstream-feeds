# Worldstream Community Feeds

Community-curated RSS feeds for [Worldstream](https://worldstream.io) - a real-time global news stream.

## 🌍 How It Works

Worldstream uses a two-tier feed system to deliver relevant content:

### Global Feeds
- Shown to **all users worldwide**
- Examples: Reuters, BBC World, TechCrunch, Hacker News
- Serves as baseline content when regional feeds are sparse
- **Priority: Filler** (shown 15% of the time in regional streams)

### Regional Feeds
- Shown **primarily to users in that region**
- Examples: NPR (US), Times of India (India), BBC UK (UK)
- **Priority: Primary** (shown 85% of the time in regional streams)

**Example:** A user viewing the US stream sees:
- 85% US regional feeds (NPR, ESPN, Politico, etc.)
- 15% global feeds (BBC, Reuters, Guardian, etc.)
